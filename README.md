# Edge-Detection_Noise-Removal

## Spatial Domain

Generate new image by convolution of image with suitable kernel.

### Edge Detection
 
- High pass filter  
- Sobel operator

### Noise Removal

- Gaussian smoothing  
- Median smoothing

## Frequency Domain

Multiply DFT of image and suitable mask. Generate image with inverse DFT.  

### Edge Detection
 
- Mask with high pass filter

### Noise Removal

- Mask with low pass filter
